# Optimization_Examples
Toy problems in mathematical optimization solved with [pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/). The examples in this notebook were taken from the course [*2021 Complete Pyomo Bootcamp: Python Optimization Beginners*](https://www.udemy.com/course/optimization-in-python/) and from [Gurobi examples](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/modeling-examples-using-the-gurobi-python-api-in-jupyter-notebook/) (which are originally from the book [Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H.Paul Williams](https://www.amazon.com.br/Model-Building-Mathematical-Programming-Williams/dp/1118443330)). Since this is part of my study on optimization, in almost every notebook I try to go a little bit further than what was presented in the previous references. Please feel free to contact me and give any feedback and constructive criticism about this repository.

- N.B.: in order to run the notebooks pyomo needs to be installed in your PC. You must also have the pre-compiled versions of the solvers, that can be found [here](https://ampl.com/products/solvers/open-source/). In each notebook, the solver executable path must be assigned to the variable solverpath_exe.
